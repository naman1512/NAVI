# NAVI – AI-Enabled Portal for Internal Support (BCG Internal Project)

> _An AI-powered internal support assistant built to streamline employee access to documentation, knowledge, and automated summaries across BCG._

## 📌 Overview

NAVI is a generative AI-driven internal portal designed to assist BCG employees in retrieving reports, documentation, and summaries from internal tools, documents, and sources. The platform integrates intelligent search, prompt engineering, and summarization capabilities to minimize manual information hunting and enable faster decision-making.
